MIRROR MODE

  To get started, you can see yourself in the mirror by running

    picturephone --mirror

  which will activate the default webcam of your laptop and render your
  text-based video feedback in your terminal.

USAGE

  Local Mirror:
    ./picturephone --mirror

  Network Host (Alice):
    ./picturephone --listen 3000

  Network Client (Bob):
    ./picturephone --connect <Alice_IP>:3000

TODO

    - [ ] Ask [accept | reject] before letting your friend in the call.

    - [ ] Support multiple people calls

    - [ ] Implement encryption of the data transmitted. Nothing standard, our
          own implementation.

    - [ ] INCREMENTAL VIDEO STREAMING CODEC OPTIMIZATION
          Consider optimizing the data transmission protocol to be incremental
          so it uses less data, and then is encoded/decoded on clients.
          Instead of sending the entirety of every frame with redundant data
          from the previous frame. Similarly, the terminal should only update
          the changed cells, not the entire picture.

    - [ ] Support linux and bsd webcam interfaces.

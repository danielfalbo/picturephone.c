  TODO

    1. NETWORK MODE: 1-on-1

      - [ ] Find a way to create peer-to-peer connections with friends. Let's
            start with just 1-on-1s.

      - [ ] Send data via a raw TCP or even UDP connection. No https or any
            other existing (encrypted) protocol. Let's implement our own
            protocol, unencrypted at first.

    2. UI

      - [ ] Ask [accept | reject] before letting your friend in the call.

      - [ ] macOS: Allow selecting which camera to use.

      - [ ] See yourself too in a small box in the bottom right corner. Also
            have an option to switch between split screen and youself in the bot
            corner.

    3. GROUP MODE: 3+ people call

      - [ ] Support multiple people calls, consider both a peer-to-peer solution
            (braindead simple, no raft) and centralizing the call (redis?).

    4. ENCRYPTION

      - [ ] Implement encryption of the data transmitted. Nothing standard, our
            own implementation.

    5. INCREMENTAL VIDEO STREAMING CODEC OPTIMIZATION

      - [ ] Consider optimizing the data transmission protocol to be incremental
            so it uses less data, and then is encoded/decoded on clients.
            Instead of sending the entirety of every frame with redundant data
            from the previous frame. Similarly, the terminal should only update
            the changed cells, not the entire picture.

    6. PORTABILITY

      - [ ] Support linux and bsd webcam interfaces.

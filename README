BUILD

  To build, just run

    make

  and that's it.

INSTALL

  You can just install this by running

    brew install danielfalbo/formulae/picturephone

  assuming you already have https://brew.sh.

USAGE

  To get started, you can see yourself in the mirror by running

    picturephone --mirror

  which will activate the default webcam of your laptop and render your
  text-based video feedback in your terminal. You can also

    picturephone --help

  to get help, or

    picturephone

  without any arguments to launch a comfortable TUI.

TODO

    - [ ] Better README.

        - [ ] SSH/Local tunnel example.

        - [ ] Section: Communication protocol.

    - [ ] Ask [accept | reject] before letting your friend in the call.

    - [ ] Support multiple people calls

    - [ ] Implement encryption of the data transmitted. Nothing standard, our
          own implementation.

    - [ ] INCREMENTAL VIDEO STREAMING CODEC OPTIMIZATION
          Consider optimizing the data transmission protocol to be incremental
          so it uses less data, and then is encoded/decoded on clients.
          Instead of sending the entirety of every frame with redundant data
          from the previous frame. Similarly, the terminal should only update
          the changed cells, not the entire picture.

    - [ ] Support linux and bsd webcam interfaces.

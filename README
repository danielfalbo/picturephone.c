  TODO

    1. --mirror MODE

      - [ ] Use macOS API to get webcam buffer.

      - [ ] Translate macOS webcam API into generic struct
            we could later use on other OSes, webcams resolutions, etc too.

      - Reminder: ensure separate the device/OS layer from the logic.

      - [ ] Interpret/convert webcam output as grayscale intensity or whatever
            is the optimized and portable but braindead simple grayscale format.

      - [ ] Convert grayscale to ASCII as seen at
            https://github.com/ertdfgcvb/play.core/blob/master/src/programs/camera/camera_gray.js

      - [ ] Output fixed-size ascii output in the terminal.

    2. NETWORK MODE: 1-on-1

    - [ ] Find a way to create peer-to-peer connections with friends. Let's
          start with just 1-on-1s.

    - [ ] Send data via a raw TCP or even UDP connection. No https or any other
          existing (encrypted) protocol. Let's implement our own protocol,
          unencrypted at first.

    3. UI

      - [ ] Change the ascii output in the terminal based on the terminal size,
            update on resize.

      - [ ] Ask [accept | reject] before letting your friend in the call.

      - [ ] See yourself too in a small box in the bottom right corner. Also
            have an option to switch between split screen and youself in the bot
            corner.

    4. GROUP MODE: 3+ people call

      - [ ] Support multiple people calls, consider both a peer-to-peer solution
            (braindead simple, no raft) and centralizing the call (redis?).

    5. ENCRYPTION

      - [ ] Implement encryption of the data transmitted. Nothing standard, our
            own implementation.

    6. INCREMENTAL VIDEO STREAMING CODEC OPTIMIZATION

      - [ ] Consider optimizing the data transmission protocol to be incremental
            so it uses less data, and then is encoded/decoded on clients.
            Instead of sending the entirety of every frame with redundant data
            from the previous frame.

    7. PORTABILITY

      - [ ] Support linux and bsd webcam interfaces.

      - Reminder: ensure separate the device/OS layer from the logic.
